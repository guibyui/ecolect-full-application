Ecolect is a application to register points of waste collection where the user can check the closest market from his house.

The application was developed using TypeScript, ReactJS, and React Native. You can run the backend, frontend, and mobile.

This application was created based on teachings of RocketSeat.

This is a new repo created to add the full Ecolect application after working on it using the project-js repo.

Images of this application can be found in the folder "application-images-output."
